        <td><b>Description</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>subject</td>
        <td>4 character subject code (e.g. ENGL, HIST, COMM).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>termcode</td>
        <td>4 Digit term code.  This is comprised of the 1st, 3rd and 4th digit of the academic year and ends with one of the following :<br><br>
1 – Summer <br>
2 – Fall<br>
3 – Fall/Winter<br>
4 – Winter <br>
5 – Spring (for CCCE career only)<br>
6 – Summer (for CCCE career only)<br><br>
For example, the code for Fall 2018 = 2182
And the code for Winter 2019 = 2184 (this is because Winter 2019 comes under the 2018 academic year).</td>
